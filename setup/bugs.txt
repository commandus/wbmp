Sure, but in unregistered version DLL adds a small logo at the bottom of image, if image size is larger than 8x8.

Please note you must provide absolute file name path or use web server's virtual roots. In example you given relative path name used; it is incorrect.

I can explain this limitation in two words- DLL does not try to search information in http header to know where is base path used in page. From other side, this information in some cases is useless.

Instead, after first startup, DLL load virtual roots used by IIS or PWS, so if your put images in folder such as /icon or /img, it works.

Yes of course

Actually I don't know. Perhaps you can find a way to use filter in web server for images (redirect to DLL or smth like this) so you can use links like src=/icon/a.jpg at the server side, but users see filtered version.

No, DLL is ISAPI module so registartion OLE automation server is not required.

It is not correct, you can save one image per one click. You can not save ALL wbmp images in folder by one click.

You can also use i2wbmp console version

i2wbmp [-?][-r][-m DitherMode][-o Path][-v] File(s)|FileMask|Directory

in your batch files.

Hmm, I dont know. I'll review why it doesnt work, at this moment you can save images using cvrt2wbmp to wbmp.
