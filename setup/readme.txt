	What WBMP is
	------------

Wireless Bitmap is a graphic format optimized for mobile computing
devices. 
A WBMP image is identified using a TypeField value, which describes
encoding information (such as pixel and palette organization,
compression, and animation) and determines image characteristics
according to WAP documentation.
TypeField values are represented by an Image Type Identifier. 
Currently, there is only one type of WMBP specified; the Image Type
Identifier label for this is 0.
0 has the following characteristics:

- No compression
- One bit color (white=1, black=0)
- One bit deep (monochrome)
Any WAP device that supports WBMPs can only support type 0.
